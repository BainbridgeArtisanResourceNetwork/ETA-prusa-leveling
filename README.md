# ETA-prusa-leveling
A collection of files useful for leveling Prusa 3D printers.

Original source of test pattern and instructions is here:
[https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/36706-bed-level-test]

Instructions for use:
* use the center square to adjust Z-offset for a printer/sheet combination
* use the front/rear/left/right squares for bed level correction after doing center
* move them to the corners if you want to dial them in further
* use the 3x3 grid for a full test (30 minutes) required.
* date and record the settings/plate/printer created.

Basic STL files and an example 3MF files are in the models/ directory.
Rendered GCode files for some printers are in the gcodes/ directory.
Detailed instructions are in the docs/ directory.
